# ðŸª„ ImageSorcery MCP Server Scripts Documentation

This document provides detailed information about each script available in the ðŸª„ ImageSorcery MCP Server, including their purpose, arguments, and examples of how to use them.

## Overview

The scripts directory contains utility scripts for model management and setup within the ðŸª„ ImageSorcery MCP Server. These scripts handle tasks such as:

- `download-models`: Downloading YOLO models from various sources
- `create-model-descriptions`: Creating model descriptions (used in `setup.sh`)
- `download-clip-models`: Downloading CLIP models required for text-based detection (YOLOe *-pf models) (used in `setup.sh`)
- `post-install-imagesorcery`: Running all post-installation tasks in a single command

These scripts are typically run during project setup or when adding new models to the system.

## Common Functions

These scripts share some common functions and patterns:

- All scripts use a central logger from `imagesorcery_mcp.logging_config`
- They typically create the `models` directory if it doesn't exist
- They handle existing files to avoid unnecessary downloads
- Progress bars are provided for downloads using `tqdm`

## Available Scripts

### `download_models.py`

Downloads YOLO compatible models for offline use from either Ultralytics or Hugging Face.

- **Purpose:** Ensures that required detection models are available for tools like `detect` and `find`.
- **Functionality:**
  - Downloads models from Ultralytics repositories
  - Downloads models from Hugging Face repositories
  - Updates the model descriptions JSON file with information about downloaded models
  - Organizes models in a proper directory structure
- **Arguments:**
  - `--ultralytics MODEL_NAME`: Download a model from Ultralytics (e.g., 'yolov8m.pt')
  - `--huggingface REPO_ID[:FILENAME]`: Download a model from Hugging Face (e.g., 'username/repo:model.pt')

**Command-line Usage:**
```bash
# Download from Ultralytics
download-yolo-models --ultralytics yolov8m.pt

# Download from Hugging Face
download-yolo-models --huggingface ultralytics/yolov8:yolov8m.pt
```

**Python Import Usage:**
```python
from imagesorcery_mcp.scripts.download_models import download_ultralytics_model, download_from_huggingface

# Download from Ultralytics
success = download_ultralytics_model('yolov8m.pt')

# Download from Hugging Face
success = download_from_huggingface('ultralytics/yolov8:yolov8m.pt')
```

#### Notes

- Downloaded models are stored in the `models` directory, which is included in `.gitignore` to prevent large model files from being committed to the repository.
- If you encounter permission issues when running these scripts, ensure you have the necessary write access to the project directory.

### `create_model_descriptions.py`

Creates a JSON file containing descriptions for various detection models in the models directory.

- **Purpose:** Ensures that model description information is available for reference by tools and users.
- **Functionality:** 
  - Creates a comprehensive list of model descriptions for various YOLO models (YOLOv8, YOLO11, YOLO-NAS, etc.)
  - Merges new descriptions with any existing ones, preserving custom descriptions
  - Writes the merged descriptions to `models/model_descriptions.json`
- **Usage:** Run directly or through the provided command-line entry point.

**Command-line Usage:**
```bash
create-model-descriptions
```

**Python Import Usage:**
```python
from imagesorcery_mcp.scripts.create_model_descriptions import create_model_descriptions

# Create the model descriptions file
result_path = create_model_descriptions()
```

### `download_clip.py`

Downloads the MobileCLIP model required for YOLOe text prompts functionality.

- **Purpose:** Ensures that the required MobileCLIP model is available for text-based detection in the `find` tool.
- **Functionality:**
  - Downloads the MobileCLIP model required for YOLOe text prompts
  - Places the model in both the models directory and root directory for compatibility
- **Usage:** Run directly or through the provided command-line entry point.

**Command-line Usage:**
```bash
download-clip-models
```

**Python Import Usage:**
```python
from imagesorcery_mcp.scripts.download_clip import download_clip_model

# Download CLIP model
success = download_clip_model()
```

### `post_install.py`

Runs all post-installation tasks for the ImageSorcery MCP server in a single command.

- **Purpose:** Automates the complete setup process after package installation.
- **Functionality:**
  - Creates the models directory
  - Generates the model descriptions file with `create-model-descriptions`
  - Downloads default YOLO models (yoloe-11l-seg-pf.pt, yoloe-11s-seg-pf.pt, yoloe-11l-seg.pt, yoloe-11s-seg.pt) with `download-yolo-models`
  - Downloads the required CLIP models for text prompts with `download-clip-models` (the CLIP Python package is installed as a project dependency)
- **Usage:** Run directly, through the server with the `--post-install` flag, or through the provided command-line entry point.

**Command-line Usage:**
```bash
# Run post-installation as a standalone script
post-install-imagesorcery

# Or run it through the server with the --post-install flag
imagesorcery-mcp --post-install
```

**Python Import Usage:**
```python
from imagesorcery_mcp.scripts.post_install import run_post_install

# Run all post-installation tasks
success = run_post_install()
if success:
    print("Post-installation completed successfully!")
else:
    print("Post-installation failed.")
```

## Example Workflow

A typical workflow for setting up the ðŸª„ ImageSorcery MCP server with all required models:

```bash
# Option 1: Complete setup with a single command
imagesorcery-mcp --post-install

# Option 2: Manual step-by-step setup
# 1. Create model descriptions
create-model-descriptions

# 2. Download required YOLO models
download-yolo-models --ultralytics yoloe-11l-seg-pf.pt
download-yolo-models --ultralytics yoloe-11s-seg-pf.pt
download-yolo-models --ultralytics yoloe-11l-seg.pt
download-yolo-models --ultralytics yoloe-11s-seg.pt

# 3. Download CLIP models for text prompts
download-clip-models
```

The `--post-install` flag is designed to automate all these steps and is the recommended approach for initial setup.
