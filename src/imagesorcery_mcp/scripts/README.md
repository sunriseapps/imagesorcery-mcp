# ðŸª„ ImageSorcery MCP Server Scripts Documentation

This document provides detailed information about each script available in the ðŸª„ ImageSorcery MCP Server, including their purpose, arguments, and examples of how to use them.

## Overview

The scripts directory contains utility scripts for model management and setup within the ðŸª„ ImageSorcery MCP Server. These scripts handle tasks such as:

- `download-models`: Downloading YOLO models from various sources
- `create-model-descriptions`: Creating model descriptions (used in `setup.sh`)
- `download-clip-models`: Downloading CLIP models required for text-based detection (YOLOe *-pf models) (used in `setup.sh`)
- `post-install-imagesorcery`: Running all post-installation tasks in a single command
- `populate_telemetry_keys.py` / `clear_telemetry_keys.py`: build-time helpers for telemetry keys management

These scripts are typically run during project setup, packaging, or when adding new models to the system.

## Common Functions

These scripts share some common functions and patterns:

- All scripts use a central logger from `imagesorcery_mcp.logging_config`
- They typically create the `models` directory if it doesn't exist
- They handle existing files to avoid unnecessary downloads
- Progress bars are provided for downloads using `tqdm`

## Available Scripts

### `download_models.py`

Downloads YOLO compatible models for offline use from either Ultralytics or Hugging Face.

- **Purpose:** Ensures that required detection models are available for tools like `detect` and `find`.
- **Functionality:**
  - Downloads models from Ultralytics repositories
  - Downloads models from Hugging Face repositories
  - Updates the model descriptions JSON file with information about downloaded models
  - Organizes models in a proper directory structure
- **Arguments:**
  - `--ultralytics MODEL_NAME`: Download a model from Ultralytics (e.g., 'yolov8m.pt')
  - `--huggingface REPO_ID[:FILENAME]`: Download a model from Hugging Face (e.g., 'username/repo:model.pt')

**Command-line Usage:**
```bash
# Download from Ultralytics
download-yolo-models --ultralytics yolov8m.pt

# Download from Hugging Face
download-yolo-models --huggingface ultralytics/yolov8:yolov8m.pt
```

**Python Import Usage:**
```python
from imagesorcery_mcp.scripts.download_models import download_ultralytics_model, download_from_huggingface

# Download from Ultralytics
success = download_ultralytics_model('yolov8m.pt')

# Download from Hugging Face
success = download_from_huggingface('ultralytics/yolov8:yolov8m.pt')
```

#### Notes

- Downloaded models are stored in the `models` directory, which is included in `.gitignore` to prevent large model files from being committed to the repository.
- If you encounter permission issues when running these scripts, ensure you have the necessary write access to the project directory.

### `create_model_descriptions.py`

Creates a JSON file containing descriptions for various detection models in the models directory.

- **Purpose:** Ensures that model description information is available for reference by tools and users.
- **Functionality:** 
  - Creates a comprehensive list of model descriptions for various YOLO models (YOLOv8, YOLO11, YOLO-NAS, etc.)
  - Merges new descriptions with any existing ones, preserving custom descriptions
  - Writes the merged descriptions to `models/model_descriptions.json`
- **Usage:** Run directly or through the provided command-line entry point.

**Command-line Usage:**
```bash
create-model-descriptions
```

**Python Import Usage:**
```python
from imagesorcery_mcp.scripts.create_model_descriptions import create_model_descriptions

# Create the model descriptions file
result_path = create_model_descriptions()
```

### `download_clip.py`

Downloads the MobileCLIP model required for YOLOe text prompts functionality.

- **Purpose:** Ensures that the required MobileCLIP model is available for text-based detection in the `find` tool.
- **Functionality:**
  - Downloads the MobileCLIP model required for YOLOe text prompts
  - Places the model in the root directory where it's expected by the find tool
- **Usage:** Run directly or through the provided command-line entry point.

**Command-line Usage:**
```bash
download-clip-models
```

**Python Import Usage:**
```python
from imagesorcery_mcp.scripts.download_clip import download_clip_model

# Download CLIP model
success = download_clip_model()
```

### `post_install.py`

Runs all post-installation tasks for the ImageSorcery MCP server in a single command.

- **Purpose:** Automates the complete setup process after package installation.
- **Functionality:**
  - Creates the models directory
  - Generates the model descriptions file with `create-model-descriptions`
  - Downloads default YOLO models (yoloe-11l-seg-pf.pt, yoloe-11s-seg-pf.pt, yoloe-11l-seg.pt, yoloe-11s-seg.pt) with `download-yolo-models`
  - Installs the `clip` Python package from Ultralytics' GitHub repository.
  - Downloads the required CLIP model file for text prompts with `download-clip-models`.
  - Ensures a `.user_id` file exists in project root (used for telemetry user identification).
- **Usage:** Run directly, through the server with the `--post-install` flag, or through the provided command-line entry point.

**Command-line Usage:**
```bash
# Run post-installation as a standalone script
python -m src.imagesorcery_mcp.scripts.post_install

# Or run it through the server with the --post-install flag
imagesorcery-mcp --post-install
```

**Python Import Usage:**
```python
from imagesorcery_mcp.scripts.post_install import run_post_install

# Run all post-installation tasks
success = run_post_install()
if success:
    print("Post-installation completed successfully!")
else:
    print("Post-installation failed.")
```

## Telemetry Keys Management (build-time)

Telemetry keys are no longer stored in `telemetry.toml`. Instead, telemetry API keys are managed via a small Python module and/or environment variables:

- Telemetry user identifier is stored in `.user_id` (created by `post_install.py`).
- API keys are provided either via environment variables or the Python module:
  - Environment variables (preferred during build/deploy):
    - `IMAGESORCERY_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY`
    - `IMAGESORCERY_POSTHOG_API_KEY`
  - Fallback module (kept in the repository as empty defaults): `src/imagesorcery_mcp/telemetry_keys.py`
    - Contains `AMPLITUDE_API_KEY = ""` and `POSTHOG_API_KEY = ""`

Rationale:
- `telemetry.toml` was unreliable in some packaging/build scenarios (it could be omitted from final artifacts). Using environment variables (and a small Python module as a fallback) ensures keys are available at runtime and during build without embedding secrets in the repo.

### `populate_telemetry_keys.py`

**Purpose**: Populate `src/imagesorcery_mcp/telemetry_keys.py` with API keys from the environment (or `.env`) during build time if desired.

**Functionality**:
- Reads `IMAGESORCERY_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY` and `IMAGESORCERY_POSTHOG_API_KEY` from environment variables (or `.env` when python-dotenv is available)
- Writes these values into `src/imagesorcery_mcp/telemetry_keys.py`
- Intended to be used in CI/build pipelines where keys are injected as environment variables before packaging

**Command-line Usage**:
```bash
python -m src.imagesorcery_mcp.scripts.populate_telemetry_keys
```

**Notes**:
- The script will not commit changes; CI should handle any necessary cleanup.
- To skip population, set `SKIP_TELEMETRY_POPULATION=true`.

### `clear_telemetry_keys.py`

**Purpose**: Clear API keys in `src/imagesorcery_mcp/telemetry_keys.py` after build to keep the repository clean.

**Functionality**:
- Overwrites `src/imagesorcery_mcp/telemetry_keys.py` with empty string defaults:
  ```py
  AMPLITUDE_API_KEY = ""
  POSTHOG_API_KEY = ""
  ```
- Intended to be invoked as a post-build/cleanup step in CI

**Command-line Usage**:
```bash
python -m src.imagesorcery_mcp.scripts.clear_telemetry_keys
```

### Recommended CI / Build Integration

A suggested pipeline for safely using telemetry keys in CI:

1. In CI, set environment variables:
   - `IMAGESORCERY_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY` and `IMAGESORCERY_POSTHOG_API_KEY`
2. Run the populate script:
   - `python -m src.imagesorcery_mcp.scripts.populate_telemetry_keys`
3. Build/package the project
4. Run the clear script to remove keys from the working copy:
   - `python -m src.imagesorcery_mcp.scripts.clear_telemetry_keys`
5. Ensure the CI does not persist telemetry_keys.py with real keys in any artifact or commit.

**Dependencies**:
- `python-dotenv` (optional) â€” used by scripts to load a `.env` file when present

**Error Handling**:
- Scripts log errors and return non-zero exit codes on failure so CI can fail fast.
