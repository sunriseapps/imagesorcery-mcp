# ðŸª„ ImageSorcery MCP Server Resources Documentation

This document provides detailed information about each resource available in the ðŸª„ ImageSorcery MCP Server, including their URIs, descriptions, and examples of how to access them using a Claude client.

## Rules

These rules apply to all contributors: humans and AI.

- Register resources by defining a `register_resource` function in each resource's module. This function should accept a `FastMCP` instance and use the `@mcp.resource()` decorator to register the resource function with the server. See `src/imagesorcery_mcp/server.py` for how resources are imported and registered, and individual resource files like `src/imagesorcery_mcp/resources/models.py` for examples of the `register_resource` function implementation.
- When adding new resources, ensure they are listed in alphabetical order in READMEs and in the server registration.


## Available Resources

### `models://list`

Lists all available models in the models directory. This resource scans the models directory and returns information about all available models, including their names, descriptions, and file paths.

- **URI:** `models://list`
- **Returns:** JSON string containing:
  - `models`: List of available models, each with:
    - `name`: Name of the model file (relative path from the models directory)
    - `description`: Description of the model's purpose and characteristics
    - `path`: Full path to the model file

**Example Claude Request:**

```
